## Hi! 

I present my latest application. Filmpire App is application for searching movies, add them to watchlist / favorites (after login to tmdb)
or just simply check some info about actors and films that they played. Filmpire had implemented Alan AI voice search with some easter eggs. ü•ö

App is created in [REACT JS](https://reactjs.org/) styled with [MATERIALUI](https://mui.com/). There is additional feature of voice searching [ALANAI](https://alan.app/)

It works good on mutlitple devices | phone üì± tablet | desktop üñ•Ô∏è
